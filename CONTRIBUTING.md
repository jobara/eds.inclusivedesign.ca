## Localization/Internationalization

### Adding new locales

Steps for adding additional locales.

1. Add [configuration](#locale-configuration) for the locale under the `languages` property in `src/_data/config.json`.
2. For each directory under `src/documents` duplicate the `en-CA` directory and rename based on the new locale:
   1. In the new directory rename the `.11tydata` file after the new directory name.
   2. [Localize](#localizing-the-content) all of the Markdown files' `title` front matter and content.
3. In `src/locales` duplicate the `fr` directory and rename based on the new locale
   1. [Update `messages.po` and generate a new `messages.mo`](#localized-strings) file in the new directory for the new
      locale.
      1. Update the `Language`
      2. Update the localized text by replacing the `msgstr` values in the `.po` file with the corresponding text from the
         new localization. Can use a tool such as [Poedit](https://poedit.net) to edit the `.po` file.
      3. Using a tool souch as [Poedit](https://poedit.net), generate a new `messages.mo` file from `messages.po`.

### Locale Configuration

The [`src/_data/config.json`](./src/_data/config.json) file contains configuration for each supported locale under the
`languages` property. Each locale is keyed with the language identifier using the
[BCP-47 syntax](https://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/) of language-locale e.g `"en-CA"` for Canadian
English. The locale must specify the following:

* **slug**: used in the URL to display the localized resource. This must be unique and match the locale being
  configured. It could be in the form of just language (e.g. `"en"`) or language-locale (e.g. `"en-CA"` or `"en-ca"`).
  For the default language, the locale slug will not be added to the URL.
* **uioSlug**: passed to UI Options widget to specify its locale to use. UI Options uses the form language (e.g `"en"`)
  or language_locale (e.g. `"en_CA"`). UI Options provides its own
  [localization](https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/tree/main/src/framework/preferences/messages) outside of the
  context of this site and will fall back to English if it does not support a requested localization.
* **dir**: The direction of the language, either `"ltr"` (left-to-right) or `"rtl"` (right-to-left). It will default to
  `"ltr"` if not specified.
* **name**: The human readable name of the language, in the locale's language. It is used to identify which languages
  are available to switch between.

For example, to add a France-French locale, the following is added to the `languages` block in
`src/_data/config.json`:

```JSON
{
    "fr-FR": {
        "slug": "fr-FR",
        "uioSlug": "fr-FR",
        "dir": "ltr",
        "name": "Français (France)"
    }
}
```

### Localizing the content

The main content of the site is all contained within the [`src/collections`](./src/collections) directory.

Each collection is split into sub-directories corresponding to the locales. Each locale directory will contain the
Markdown files for each page in the collection. These should be the same across all locale directories within a
collection; with the content of the files being localized as needed.

For example if adding a new page called "Activities" we'd add a `Activities.md` file to each locale. e.g.
`src/collections/pages/en-CA/Activities.md` and `src/collections/pages/fr-FR/Activities.md`. They both retain the same
file name, which allows for switching between the localized version with the language switcher on the site.

The English (`en-CA`) version might look like.

```Markdown
---
title: Activities
eleventyNavigation:
    parent: Pages
    key: My Activity
---

Content for My Activity.

```

The French (`fr-FR`) version might look like.

```Markdown
---
title: Activités
eleventyNavigation:
    parent: Pages
    key: My Activity
---

Contenu pour Mon Activité.
```

It's important to note that only two parts are localized; the main content portion of the Markdown file, and the `title`
in the YAML front matter. Other portions of the front matter is likely not localized as it is often used for
configuration as opposed to content. In the above example, the `eleventyNavigation` configures the category page
navigation.

Additionally each, locale directory will contain an
[11ty data file](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-template-dir/) which is named after the locale directly. For example:
`src/activities/en-CA` contains the `en-CA.11tydata.js` file. The 11ty data files contain configuration for setting up
the [eleventy-plugin-i18n-gettext](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eleventy-plugin-i18n-gettext) used on the page for
other localizations. It populates the `locale`, `lang` and `langDir` properties and the localization related
functions/shortcodes/filters available in the templates. (See:
[Eleventy plugin i18n gettext  - i18n.enhance11tydata(obj, locale, dir?)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eleventy-plugin-i18n-gettext#i18nenhance11tydataobj-locale-dir)
) Other than the name of the file, the contents are all identical, and can be copied and renamed when adding additional
locales or collections. These files need to be added for each locale directory as the `locale` value set by them is
sourced from the locale directory name.

#### Localizing other text

While most of the localized text is contained within the Markdown `.md` files located in `./src/documents/` , there are
other text strings that need localization like the header, the footer, aria-labels, and navigation. These strings can be
found in the following locations:

*[./src/_includes/layouts/layouts/](./src/_includes/layouts)
*[./src/_includes/partials/](./src/_includes/partials)

In these cases, [gettext](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/) style localization features provided by
[eleventy-plugin-i18n-gettext](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eleventy-plugin-i18n-gettext) are used.

The Nunjucks templates located in [./src/_includes/layouts/layouts/](./src/_includes/layouts) and
[./src/_includes/partials/](./src/_includes/partials) use ways to include translatable strings via a function call:

* `{{ _() }}` - takes a `key` which is the text to be translated. Example: `{{ _("Home") }}`.
* `{{ _i() }}` - allows for interpolation of values into the translated string. Example:
  `{{ _i("licensed under a${license}.", {license: "license"}) | safe }}`.

For example:

```Nunjucks
<h1>{{ _("Example") }}</h1>

<p>{{ _i("Using ${templateName} template engine.", {templateName: "Nunjucks"}) }}</p>
```

Would render the follwing in English:

```HTML
<h1>Example</h1>

<p>Using Nunjucks template engine</p>
```

A French localization might render like:

```HTML
<h1>Exemple</h1>

<p>Utiliser le moteur de template Nunjucks</p>
```

In JavaScript, import the [eleventy-plugin-i18n-gettext](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eleventy-plugin-i18n-gettext) and
make calls to the functions.

```JavaScript
"use strict";

const i18n = require("eleventy-plugin-i18n-gettext");

module.exports = (data) => {
    const locale = "en-CA";
    return i18n._(locale, "To translate");
};
```

_**NOTE**: locale variables need to be prefixed with `locale_` due to [eleventy-plugin-i18n-gettext issue #22](https://github.com/sgissinger/eleventy-plugin-i18n-gettext/issues/22)._

_**NOTE**: Ensure that `key`  is plain text when using gettext function calls, otherwise it will not be included in the
`messages.js` file which is used by `.po` file editors.  See
[eleventy-plugin-i18n-gettext issue #23](https://github.com/sgissinger/eleventy-plugin-i18n-gettext/issues/23). As a
workaround for JavaScript and templates, resolve the `key` variable elsewhere. For example the category names used in
URLs are explicitly called in `src/_data/site.js`._

##### Localized strings

The specific localization strings are provided in the `.po` and/or `.mo` files located in the
`[./src/locales/](./src/locales)` directory. The strings to translate are automatically added to
[messages.js](./src/locales/messages.js) when a build is generated (i.e. `npm start`). This also allows translation
tools like [Poedit](https://poedit.net) to facilitate editing strings that need to be translated. Alternatively, `.po`
files can be manually edited and `.mo` files generated using other tools (i.e. `msgfmt` command-line tool).

###### Using Poedit

A JavaScript extractor is needed when first setting up Poedit. See
[Poedit configuration for translations extraction](https://github.com/sgissinger/eleventy-plugin-i18n-gettext/blob/HEAD/docs/Manage-translations-with-Poedit.md)
for information about setup.

To update the `.po` and `.mo` files perform the following steps:

1. Launch Poedit.
2. Browse and open the `.po` file to edit.
3. Select `Translations > Update from Source Code`.
   * This will update the `.po` file with all of the current translations.
   * If this step does not find the available localizations from the `./src/locales/messages.js` file, ensure that the
     source paths are set correctly: `Translations > Properties... > Source Paths`.
4. Select the "Source Text" to localize, add the necessary "Translation".
5. To remove old strings go to: `Translations > Purge Deleted Translations`.
6. Save.
7. Make sure to commit the updates `.po` and `.mo` files to the working repository.
